             More precisely @see https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBIDE-1077#comment-12466929:
			"Unfortunately we can't use this context menu... "Refactor" is assembled programmatically by JDT and it ignores any custom extensions."

             and            @see https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBIDE-1077#comment-12466953
			"Me, Viktor and Denis tried to find a way to add any custom action in "Refactor" menu. We tried to use standard Eclipse extension points to point it to the same menu as JDT does but without success.
			Viktor found out that JDT hard codes items for that menu and it seems that there is no way to add our item there. But it was almost a year ago and maybe JDT has changed something... I doubt that but anyway let's research it in Eclipse 3.5."
